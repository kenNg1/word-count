# word-count

Open this app in heroku via https://protected-dusk-25674.herokuapp.com/ 

This application is called word-count made by Ken Ng. This will identify the number of times a word appears in a sentence or passage. This application has two modes, exact and partial. It will ignore punctuation and case sensitivity. Exact matching means searching for "is" in "Coding is awesome Isabelle" will return 1. Whereas partial matching of this will return 2.

To use this, a user would fill in a passage or sentence and fill in a word to identify. Then choose whether to check the box and press Send. This will take you to a new page with the result! 

README should include application name, author name, description, setup instructions, licensing.
